TI  - Diet strategies for promoting healthy aging and longevity: An epidemiological 
      perspective.
PG  - 508-531
LID - 10.1111/joim.13728 [doi]
AB  - In recent decades, global life expectancies have risen significantly, accompanied 
      by a marked increase in chronic diseases and population aging. This narrative 
      review aims to summarize recent findings on the dietary factors influencing 
      chronic diseases and longevity, primarily from large cohort studies. First, 
      maintaining a healthy weight throughout life is pivotal for healthy aging and 
      longevity, mirroring the benefits of lifelong, moderate calorie restriction in 
      today's obesogenic food environment. Second, the specific types or food sources 
      of dietary fat, protein, and carbohydrates are more important in influencing 
      chronic disease risk and mortality than their quantity. Third, some traditional 
      diets (e.g., the Mediterranean, Nordic, and Okinawa) and contemporary dietary 
      patterns, such as healthy plant-based diet index, the DASH (dietary approaches to 
      stop hypertension) diet, and alternate healthy eating index, have been associated 
      with lower mortality and healthy longevity. These patterns share many common 
      components (e.g., a predominance of nutrient-rich plant foods; limited red and 
      processed meats; culinary herbs and spices prevalent in global cuisines) while 
      embracing distinct elements from different cultures. Fourth, combining a healthy 
      diet with other lifestyle factors could extend disease-free life expectancies by 
      8-10 years. While adhering to core principles of healthy diets, it is crucial to 
      adapt dietary recommendations to individual preferences and cultures as well as 
      nutritional needs of aging populations. Public health strategies should aim to 
      create a healthier food environment where nutritious options are readily 
      accessible, especially in public institutions and care facilities for the 
      elderly. Although further mechanistic studies and human trials are needed to 
      better understand molecular effects of diet on aging, there is a pressing need to 
      establish and maintain long-term cohorts studying diet and aging in culturally 
      diverse populations.

TI  - Fast-food restaurant, unhealthy eating, and childhood obesity: A systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e12944

LID - e12944
AB  - Excessive access to fast-food restaurants (FFRs) in the neighbourhood is thought 
      to be a risk factor for childhood obesity by discouraging healthful dietary 
      behaviours while encouraging the exposure to unhealthful food venues and hence 
      the compensatory intake of unhealthy food option. A literature search was 
      conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for articles published until 
      1 January 2019 that analysed the association between access to FFRs and 
      weight-related behaviours and outcomes among children aged younger than 18. 
      Sixteen cohort studies and 71 cross-sectional studies conducted in 14 countries 
      were identified. While higher FFR access was not associated with weight-related 
      behaviours (eg, dietary quality score and frequency of food consumption) in most 
      studies, it was commonly associated with more fast-food consumption. Despite 
      that, insignificant results were observed for all meta-analyses conducted by 
      different measures of FFR access in the neighbourhood and weight-related 
      outcomes, although 17 of 39 studies reported positive associations when using 
      overweight/obesity as the outcome. This systematic review and meta-analysis 
      revealed a rather mixed relationship between FFR access and weight-related 
      behaviours/outcomes among children and adolescents.

AB  - The obesity epidemic is caused by the misalignment between human biology and the 
      modern food environment, which has led to unhealthy eating patterns and behaviors 
      and an increase in metabolic diseases. This has been caused by the shift from a 
      "leptogenic" to an "obesogenic" food environment, characterized by the 
      availability of unhealthy food and the ability to eat at any time of day due to 
      advances in technology. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is the most commonly 
      diagnosed eating disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating 
      and a sense of loss of control over eating, and is treated with 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy-enhanced (CBT-E). Shift work, especially night shift 
      work, can disrupt the body's natural circadian rhythms and increase the risk of 
      obesity and other negative health consequences, such as cardiovascular disease 
      and metabolic syndrome. One dietary approach to address circadian dysregulation 
      is time-restricted eating (TRE), which involves restricting food intake to 
      specific periods of the day to synchronize the body's internal clock with the 
      external environment. TRE has been found to cause modest weight loss and improve 
      metabolic outcomes such as insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, but the extent 
      to which it is beneficial may depend on adherence and other factors such as 
      caloric restriction.

AB  - Eating behavior and food-related decision making are among the most complex of 
      the motivated behaviors, and understanding the neurobiology of eating behavior, 
      and its developmental dynamics, is critical to advancing the nutritional sciences 
      and public health. Recent advances from both human and animal studies are 
      revealing that individual capacity to make health-promoting food decisions varies 
      based on biological and physiological variation in the signaling pathways that 
      regulate the homeostatic, hedonic, and executive functions; past developmental 
      exposures and current life-stage; the food environment; and complications of 
      chronic disease that reinforce the obese state. Eating rate drives increased 
      calorie intake and represents an important opportunity to lower rates of food 
      consumption and energy intake through product reformulation. Understanding human 
      eating behaviors and nutrition in the context of neuroscience can strengthen the 
      evidence base from which dietary guidelines are derived and can inform policies, 
      practices, and educational programs in a way that increases the likelihood they 
      are adopted and effective for reducing rates of obesity and other diet-related 
      chronic disease.

TI  - Environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes-an exposome approach.
PG  - 263-274
LID - 10.1007/s00125-021-05618-w [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases accounting for a substantial 
      proportion of disease burden in Western countries. The majority of the burden of 
      type 2 diabetes is attributed to environmental risks and modifiable risk factors 
      such as lifestyle. The environment we live in, and changes to it, can thus 
      contribute substantially to the prevention of type 2 diabetes at a population 
      level. The 'exposome' represents the (measurable) totality of environmental, i.e. 
      nongenetic, drivers of health and disease. The external exposome comprises 
      aspects of the built environment, the social environment, the physico-chemical 
      environment and the lifestyle/food environment. The internal exposome comprises 
      measurements at the epigenetic, transcript, proteome, microbiome or metabolome 
      level to study either the exposures directly, the imprints these exposures leave 
      in the biological system, the potential of the body to combat environmental 
      insults and/or the biology itself. In this review, we describe the evidence for 
      environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes, focusing on both the general 
      external exposome and imprints of this on the internal exposome. Studies provided 
      established associations of air pollution, residential noise and area-level 
      socioeconomic deprivation with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while 
      neighbourhood walkability and green space are consistently associated with a 
      reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. There is little or inconsistent evidence on the 
      contribution of the food environment, other aspects of the social environment and 
      outdoor temperature. These environmental factors are thought to affect type 2 
      diabetes risk mainly through mechanisms incorporating lifestyle factors such as 
      physical activity or diet, the microbiome, inflammation or chronic stress. To 
      further assess causality of these associations, future studies should focus on 
      investigating the longitudinal effects of our environment (and changes to it) in 
      relation to type 2 diabetes risk and whether these associations are explained by 
      these proposed mechanisms.

TI  - Increasing Access to Healthy Foods through Improving Food Environment: A Review 
      of Mixed Methods Intervention Studies with Residents of Low-Income Communities.
LID - 10.3390/nu14112278 [doi]
LID - 2278
AB  - Food insecurity is a broad and serious public health issue in the United States, 
      where many people are reporting lack of access to healthy foods. The reduced 
      availability of healthy, affordable foods has led to increased consumption of 
      energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods, resulting in increasing the risk for many 
      chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Thus, identifying promising approaches to increase access to healthy 
      foods through improving the food environment is of importance. The purpose of 
      this review article is to highlight how the food environment affects directly a 
      person's food choices, and how to increase access to healthy foods through 
      improving environmental approaches. The literature search was focused on finding 
      different approaches to improve food security, primarily those with an impact on 
      food environment. Overall, potential solutions were gathered through multilevel 
      environmental approaches, including nutrition education and peer education, 
      community-based participatory research, and policy changes in supplemental 
      nutrition programs. A recommendation to reduce food insecurity is learning to 
      create meals with a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables purchased from 
      affordable farmers' markets.

TI  - Association of Food Deserts and Food Swamps With Obesity-Related Cancer Mortality 
      in the US.
PG  - 909-916
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.0634 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Obesity-related cancers account for 40% of all cancers in the US. 
      Healthy food consumption is a modifiable factor shown to reduce obesity-related 
      cancer mortality, but residing in areas with less access to grocery stores (food 
      deserts) or higher access to fast food (food swamps) reduces healthy food access 
      and has been understudied. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of food deserts 
      and food swamps with obesity-related cancer mortality in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional ecologic study used US Department of 
      Agriculture Food Environment Atlas data from 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2020 and 
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mortality data from 2010 to 2020. A 
      total of 3038 US counties or county equivalents with complete information on food 
      environment scores and obesity-related cancer mortality data were included. An 
      age-adjusted, generalized, mixed-effects regression model was performed for the 
      association of food desert and food swamp scores with obesity-related cancer 
      mortality rates. Data were analyzed from September 9, 2022, to September 30, 
      2022. EXPOSURES: Food swamp score was calculated as the ratio of fast-food and 
      convenience stores to grocery stores and farmers markets. Higher food swamp and 
      food desert scores (20.0 to ≥58.0) indicated counties with fewer healthy food 
      resources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Obesity-related cancer (based on the 
      International Agency for Research on Cancer evidence between obesity and 13 types 
      of cancer) mortality rates were categorized as high (≥71.8 per 100 000 
      population) vs low (<71.8 per 100 000 population) per county. RESULTS: A total of 
      3038 counties or county equivalents with high obesity-related cancer mortality 
      rates had a higher percentage of non-Hispanic Black residents (3.26% [IQR, 
      0.47%-26.35%] vs 1.77% [IQR, 0.43%-8.48%]), higher percentage of persons older 
      than 65 years (15.71% [IQR, 13.73%-18.00%] vs 15.40% [IQR, 12.82%-18.09%]), 
      higher poverty rates (19.00% [IQR, 14.20%-23.70%] vs 14.40% [IQR, 
      11.00%-18.50%]), higher adult obesity rates (33.00% [IQR, 32.00%-35.00%] vs 
      32.10% [IQR, 29.30%-33.20%]), and higher adult diabetes rates (12.50% [IQR, 
      11.00%-14.20%] vs 10.70% [IQR, 9.30%-12.40%]) compared with counties or county 
      equivalents with low obesity-related cancer mortality. There was a 77% increased 
      odds of having high obesity-related cancer mortality rates among US counties or 
      county equivalents with high food swamp scores (adjusted odds ratio, 1.77; 95% 
      CI, 1.43-2.19). A positive dose-response relationship among 3 levels of food 
      desert and food swamp scores and obesity-related cancer mortality was also 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cross-sectional 
      ecologic study suggest that policy makers, funding agencies, and community 
      stakeholders should implement sustainable approaches to combating obesity and 
      cancer and establishing access to healthier food, such as creating more walkable 
      neighborhoods and community gardens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This commentary discusses the New Zealand Labour Party's announcement 
      to remove tax on fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables. It aims to explore its 
      potential impact on the psychological well-being of New Zealanders in the context 
      of the growing global burden of mental illnesses in the current food environment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tax exemption on fruits and vegetables demonstrates the 
      government's commitment to improving the food environment. While the precise 
      mental health effects of this potential tax change remain unstudied, existing 
      evidence suggests a positive impact on New Zealanders' well-being, marking a 
      pivotal step in addressing broader health issues and fostering a healthier, more 
      equitable food landscape.
