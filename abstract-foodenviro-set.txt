In recent decades, global life expectancies have risen significantly, 
accompanied by a marked increase in chronic diseases and population aging. This 
narrative review aims to summarize recent findings on the dietary factors 
influencing chronic diseases and longevity, primarily from large cohort studies. 
First, maintaining a healthy weight throughout life is pivotal for healthy aging 
and longevity, mirroring the benefits of lifelong, moderate calorie restriction 
in today's obesogenic food environment. Second, the specific types or food 
sources of dietary fat, protein, and carbohydrates are more important in 
influencing chronic disease risk and mortality than their quantity. Third, some 
traditional diets (e.g., the Mediterranean, Nordic, and Okinawa) and 
contemporary dietary patterns, such as healthy plant-based diet index, the DASH 
(dietary approaches to stop hypertension) diet, and alternate healthy eating 
index, have been associated with lower mortality and healthy longevity. These 
patterns share many common components (e.g., a predominance of nutrient-rich 
plant foods; limited red and processed meats; culinary herbs and spices 
prevalent in global cuisines) while embracing distinct elements from different 
cultures. Fourth, combining a healthy diet with other lifestyle factors could 
extend disease-free life expectancies by 8-10 years. While adhering to core 
principles of healthy diets, it is crucial to adapt dietary recommendations to 
individual preferences and cultures as well as nutritional needs of aging 
populations. Public health strategies should aim to create a healthier food 
environment where nutritious options are readily accessible, especially in 
public institutions and care facilities for the elderly. Although further 
mechanistic studies and human trials are needed to better understand molecular 
effects of diet on aging, there is a pressing need to establish and maintain 
long-term cohorts studying diet and aging in culturally diverse populations.

Excessive access to fast-food restaurants (FFRs) in the neighbourhood is thought 
to be a risk factor for childhood obesity by discouraging healthful dietary 
behaviours while encouraging the exposure to unhealthful food venues and hence 
the compensatory intake of unhealthy food option. A literature search was 
conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for articles published until 
1 January 2019 that analysed the association between access to FFRs and 
weight-related behaviours and outcomes among children aged younger than 18. 
Sixteen cohort studies and 71 cross-sectional studies conducted in 14 countries 
were identified. While higher FFR access was not associated with weight-related 
behaviours (eg, dietary quality score and frequency of food consumption) in most 
studies, it was commonly associated with more fast-food consumption. Despite 
that, insignificant results were observed for all meta-analyses conducted by 
different measures of FFR access in the neighbourhood and weight-related 
outcomes, although 17 of 39 studies reported positive associations when using 
overweight/obesity as the outcome. This systematic review and meta-analysis 
revealed a rather mixed relationship between FFR access and weight-related 
behaviours/outcomes among children and adolescents.

The obesity epidemic is caused by the misalignment between human biology and the 
modern food environment, which has led to unhealthy eating patterns and 
behaviors and an increase in metabolic diseases. This has been caused by the 
shift from a "leptogenic" to an "obesogenic" food environment, characterized by 
the availability of unhealthy food and the ability to eat at any time of day due 
to advances in technology. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is the most commonly 
diagnosed eating disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating 
and a sense of loss of control over eating, and is treated with 
cognitive-behavioral therapy-enhanced (CBT-E). Shift work, especially night 
shift work, can disrupt the body's natural circadian rhythms and increase the 
risk of obesity and other negative health consequences, such as cardiovascular 
disease and metabolic syndrome. One dietary approach to address circadian 
dysregulation is time-restricted eating (TRE), which involves restricting food 
intake to specific periods of the day to synchronize the body's internal clock 
with the external environment. TRE has been found to cause modest weight loss 
and improve metabolic outcomes such as insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, 
but the extent to which it is beneficial may depend on adherence and other 
factors such as caloric restriction.

Eating behavior and food-related decision making are among the most complex of 
the motivated behaviors, and understanding the neurobiology of eating behavior, 
and its developmental dynamics, is critical to advancing the nutritional 
sciences and public health. Recent advances from both human and animal studies 
are revealing that individual capacity to make health-promoting food decisions 
varies based on biological and physiological variation in the signaling pathways 
that regulate the homeostatic, hedonic, and executive functions; past 
developmental exposures and current life-stage; the food environment; and 
complications of chronic disease that reinforce the obese state. Eating rate 
drives increased calorie intake and represents an important opportunity to lower 
rates of food consumption and energy intake through product reformulation. 
Understanding human eating behaviors and nutrition in the context of 
neuroscience can strengthen the evidence base from which dietary guidelines are 
derived and can inform policies, practices, and educational programs in a way 
that increases the likelihood they are adopted and effective for reducing rates 
of obesity and other diet-related chronic disease.

Type 2 diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases accounting for a 
substantial proportion of disease burden in Western countries. The majority of 
the burden of type 2 diabetes is attributed to environmental risks and 
modifiable risk factors such as lifestyle. The environment we live in, and 
changes to it, can thus contribute substantially to the prevention of type 2 
diabetes at a population level. The 'exposome' represents the (measurable) 
totality of environmental, i.e. nongenetic, drivers of health and disease. The 
external exposome comprises aspects of the built environment, the social 
environment, the physico-chemical environment and the lifestyle/food 
environment. The internal exposome comprises measurements at the epigenetic, 
transcript, proteome, microbiome or metabolome level to study either the 
exposures directly, the imprints these exposures leave in the biological system, 
the potential of the body to combat environmental insults and/or the biology 
itself. In this review, we describe the evidence for environmental risk factors 
of type 2 diabetes, focusing on both the general external exposome and imprints 
of this on the internal exposome. Studies provided established associations of 
air pollution, residential noise and area-level socioeconomic deprivation with 
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while neighbourhood walkability and green 
space are consistently associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. There 
is little or inconsistent evidence on the contribution of the food environment, 
other aspects of the social environment and outdoor temperature. These 
environmental factors are thought to affect type 2 diabetes risk mainly through 
mechanisms incorporating lifestyle factors such as physical activity or diet, 
the microbiome, inflammation or chronic stress. To further assess causality of 
these associations, future studies should focus on investigating the 
longitudinal effects of our environment (and changes to it) in relation to type 
2 diabetes risk and whether these associations are explained by these proposed 
mechanisms.

Food insecurity is a broad and serious public health issue in the United States, 
where many people are reporting lack of access to healthy foods. The reduced 
availability of healthy, affordable foods has led to increased consumption of 
energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods, resulting in increasing the risk for many 
chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Thus, identifying promising approaches to increase access to healthy 
foods through improving the food environment is of importance. The purpose of 
this review article is to highlight how the food environment affects directly a 
person's food choices, and how to increase access to healthy foods through 
improving environmental approaches. The literature search was focused on finding 
different approaches to improve food security, primarily those with an impact on 
food environment. Overall, potential solutions were gathered through multilevel 
environmental approaches, including nutrition education and peer education, 
community-based participatory research, and policy changes in supplemental 
nutrition programs. A recommendation to reduce food insecurity is learning to 
create meals with a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables purchased from 
affordable farmers' markets.

IMPORTANCE: Obesity-related cancers account for 40% of all cancers in the US. 
Healthy food consumption is a modifiable factor shown to reduce obesity-related 
cancer mortality, but residing in areas with less access to grocery stores (food 
deserts) or higher access to fast food (food swamps) reduces healthy food access 
and has been understudied.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of food deserts and food swamps with 
obesity-related cancer mortality in the US.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional ecologic study used US 
Department of Agriculture Food Environment Atlas data from 2012, 2014, 2015, 
2017, and 2020 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mortality data 
from 2010 to 2020. A total of 3038 US counties or county equivalents with 
complete information on food environment scores and obesity-related cancer 
mortality data were included. An age-adjusted, generalized, mixed-effects 
regression model was performed for the association of food desert and food swamp 
scores with obesity-related cancer mortality rates. Data were analyzed from 
September 9, 2022, to September 30, 2022.
EXPOSURES: Food swamp score was calculated as the ratio of fast-food and 
convenience stores to grocery stores and farmers markets. Higher food swamp and 
food desert scores (20.0 to ≥58.0) indicated counties with fewer healthy food 
resources.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Obesity-related cancer (based on the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer evidence between obesity and 13 types of cancer) 
mortality rates were categorized as high (≥71.8 per 100 000 population) vs low 
(<71.8 per 100 000 population) per county.
RESULTS: A total of 3038 counties or county equivalents with high 
obesity-related cancer mortality rates had a higher percentage of non-Hispanic 
Black residents (3.26% [IQR, 0.47%-26.35%] vs 1.77% [IQR, 0.43%-8.48%]), higher 
percentage of persons older than 65 years (15.71% [IQR, 13.73%-18.00%] vs 15.40% 
[IQR, 12.82%-18.09%]), higher poverty rates (19.00% [IQR, 14.20%-23.70%] vs 
14.40% [IQR, 11.00%-18.50%]), higher adult obesity rates (33.00% [IQR, 
32.00%-35.00%] vs 32.10% [IQR, 29.30%-33.20%]), and higher adult diabetes rates 
(12.50% [IQR, 11.00%-14.20%] vs 10.70% [IQR, 9.30%-12.40%]) compared with 
counties or county equivalents with low obesity-related cancer mortality. There 
was a 77% increased odds of having high obesity-related cancer mortality rates 
among US counties or county equivalents with high food swamp scores (adjusted 
odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.43-2.19). A positive dose-response relationship 
among 3 levels of food desert and food swamp scores and obesity-related cancer 
mortality was also observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cross-sectional ecologic study 
suggest that policy makers, funding agencies, and community stakeholders should 
implement sustainable approaches to combating obesity and cancer and 
establishing access to healthier food, such as creating more walkable 
neighborhoods and community gardens.

OBJECTIVE: This commentary discusses the New Zealand Labour Party's announcement 
to remove tax on fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables. It aims to explore its 
potential impact on the psychological well-being of New Zealanders in the 
context of the growing global burden of mental illnesses in the current food 
environment.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tax exemption on fruits and vegetables demonstrates 
the government's commitment to improving the food environment. While the precise 
mental health effects of this potential tax change remain unstudied, existing 
evidence suggests a positive impact on New Zealanders' well-being, marking a 
pivotal step in addressing broader health issues and fostering a healthier, more 
equitable food landscape.
